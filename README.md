# Template for a Multi-page Streamlit App

A simple multi-page stock dashboard app that can be used to create your own 
multi-page app for BA870-AC820.

## Description

This GitHub repository contains a working prototype for an interactive
multi-page Streamlit Dashboard App. It demonstrates how to store data in a
"session state" that allows data to be persistently shared across pages. 

There are 5 python programs used to created the 4 interactive and
connected pages in the app:
- "streamlit_app.py" in the main directory (defines the code for the 4 pages)
- "main.py" - The homepage for the app located in the /pages subdirectory
- "page1.py" - Page 1 of the app located in the /pages subdirectory
- "page2.py" - Page 2 of the app located in the /pages subdirectory
- "page3.py" - Page 3 of the app located in the /pages subdirectory

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* The "requirement.txt" file contains the necessary libraries
